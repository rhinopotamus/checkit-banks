Consider the circle centered at the point <m>{{center}}</m> whose circumference is <m>{{circumference}}</m>. 
Let <m>h = f(d)</m> be the circular function that tracks the height, <m>h</m>, 
of a point traversing the circle {{direction}} by starting at the point <m>P_0</m>,
where <m>d</m> is the distance the point is along the circle from <m>P_0</m>. 
Find the exact coordinates of 4 points on the circle, and give your best guess for two more. 
Then, sketch an accurate graph of <m>h = f(d)</m>, clearly labeling at least
6 different points on the function, and state the midline, amplitude, and period of the function. Provide a
written summary of your computations and thinking.

        <p>Here are some important things that will help us figure out points on this circle:</p>
        <list>
            <item><p>Since the circumference is {{circumference}}, the <em>period</em> of <m>f(d)</m> is {{circumference}}.</p></item>
            <item><p>The distance between each point marked on the circle is <m>\frac{ {{circumference}} }{8} = {{deltad}}</m>.</p></item>
            <item><p>Since the circle is centered at <m>{{center}}</m>, the <em>midline</em> of <m>f(d)</m> is <m> y = {{yc}}</m>.</p></item>
            <item><p>Since the circumference is {{circumference}}, the radius is <m>\frac{ {{circumference}} }{2\pi} \approx {{radius}}</m>.
            This will be the <em>amplitude</em> of <m>f(d)</m>.</p></item>
        </list>

        <p>(Note that this graph is incomplete because it doesn't have points labeled on it!)</p>
