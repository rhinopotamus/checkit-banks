For each of the following parts, draw and clearly label a picture, and use
that picture to find the <em>exact</em> values of the missing pieces of
the right triangle. <em>No squequals, please!</em>
    </p>
    <p><em>Part (a):</em></p>
        <p>
In a certain right triangle, one angle measures <m>{{angle1A}}</m> radians
and <m>{{sideA}}</m> has length <m>{{length1A}}</m>.
Find the <em>exact</em> measure of the non-right angle and the 
<em>exact</em> lengths of the other two sides. 
        </p>
    <p><em>Part (b):</em></p>
        <p>
In a given right triangle, 
<m>{{side1B}}</m> has length <m>{{length1B}}</m> and 
            <m>{{side2B}}</m> has length <m>{{length2B}}</m>.
Find the exact length of the remaining side and 
both exact and approximate measures of the two non-right angles 
(both in radians).
        </p>
    <p><em>Part (c):</em></p>
        <p>
Consider the right triangle with hypotenuse <m>{{hypC}}</m>, 
horizontal leg <m>{{adjC}}</m>, and vertical leg <m>{{oppC}}</m>, with angle 
<m>\theta</m> opposite the vertical leg.  
How can we view <m>{{v1}}</m> as depending on <m>{{v2}}</m> only?  
How can we view <m>{{v1}}</m> as depending on <m>\theta</m> only?

        <p><em>Partial answer:</em></p>

        <p><em>Part (a):</em></p>
        <p>
            The side adjacent to the given angle is <m>{{adjA}}</m>.
            The side opposite to the given angle is <m>{{oppA}}</m>.
            The hypotenuse is <m>{{hypA}}</m>.
            The other non-right angle is <m>{{angle2A}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p><em>Part (b):</em></p>
        <p>
            The two legs have length <m>{{adjB}}</m> and <m>{{oppB}}</m>.
            The hypotenuse has length <m>{{hypB}}</m>. The two angles are
            <m>{{angle1B}}</m> and <m>{{angle2B}}</m>
        </p>
        <p><em>Part (c):</em></p>
        <p><m>{{v1}} = {{ans1C}}</m>, and <m>{{v1}} = {{ans2C}}</m>.</p>
